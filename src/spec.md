# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Acknowledge platform limitations for the Focus app request and clarify that web applications cannot implement device-level content filtering or system-wide app restrictions.

**Planned changes:**
- None

**User-visible outcome:** The user understands that the requested Focus app features (blocking adult content, restricting app usage, system-level controls) cannot be implemented as a web application on the Internet Computer platform, as these capabilities require native mobile OS permissions and system-level access that web apps do not have.
