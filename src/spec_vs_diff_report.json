  "summary": "The implementation delivers a landing page for a native mobile app concept (Focus) that acknowledges platform limitations. However, the features section describes capabilities (content filtering, app time limits, system-level protection) that contradict the BuildRequest's explicit constraints and non-goals. The BuildRequest states these features require native mobile OS capabilities and cannot be implemented in web applications, yet the landing page markets them as if they will be delivered.",
